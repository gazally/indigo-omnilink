	 * REQUEST OBJECT PROPERTIES
This message requests the HAI controller to report the properties of the specified object. The object type and index
number specifies what is being requested. The object type identifies whether the requested object is a zone, unit,
button, code, area, thermostat, message, auxiliary sensor, audio source, audio zone, expansion, or console. The
index number (0-511) identifies the specific object.
The index number is used in conjunction with the relative direction (offset) value to determine which object in the
list will be sent. If the offset is 0, the controller will return the properties of the specified object (index number). If
the offset is -1, the controller will return the properties of the object before the specified index number. If the offset
is 1, the controller will return the properties of the object after the specified index number.
Filters are used to narrow the return to an object with specific properties.
Filter 1: allows only named objects to be returned (0=Named or Unnamed, 1=Named, 2=Unnamed).
Filter 2: allows only an object that is in specific Areas to be returned. The area statuses for eight areas are packed
           into one message byte. The status for Area 1 is indicated by bit 7. Lower order bits indicate the statuses of
           Area 2 â€“ Area 8, respectively. The bits corresponding to specified Areas are on.
Filter 3: allows only an object that is defined as a Load in a Room, Room, or Independent Load to be returned
           (0=Any Load, 1-31=Load in a Room, 254=Room, 255=Independent Load).

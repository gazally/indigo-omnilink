	 *ZONE STATUS
The controller reports the status of a zone object or group of zone objects. The status reported for each
zone includes the zone number, current condition of the zone (secure, not ready, or trouble), the latched
alarm status for the zone, whether the zone is armed, whether the zone has had any trouble, and the current
analog loop reading for the zone.

The zone status for a zone is packed into a single byte. Bits 0 and 1 indicate the zoneâ€™s current condition:
         Bit 1     Bit 0             Current Condition
         0         0                 Secure
         0         1                 Not ready
         1         0                 Trouble
Bits 2 and 3 indicate the latched alarm status for the zone:
         Bit 3     Bit 2             Latched Alarm Status
         0         0                 Secure
         0         1                 Tripped
         1         0                 Reset, but previously tripped
Bits 4 and 5 indicate the arming status for the zone:
         Bit 5     Bit 4             Arming Status
         0         0                 Disarmed
         0         1                 Armed
         1         0                 Bypassed by user
         1         1                 Bypassed by system


Bit 6 is set if a trouble condition has occurred that has not been acknowledged by the user. The current
condition of the zone will indicate whether the zone currently has a trouble condition. If the zone does not
currently have a trouble condition, but bit 6 is set, it indicates that the zone has previously had a trouble
condition that has not yet been acknowledged.

class PluginExtension(object):
    """Base class for Plugin Extensions.

    Class attributes:
        plugin -- This is set by the plugin instance to itself, so that
            extension methods which get added to the plugin have an easy
            way to access it.
        MODEL -- a string that all extensions should use as the model name
            of new devices they create

    Class attributes which should be changed in the __init__ of subclasses
    to instance attributes:
        type_ids -- This should be set to a dictionary with the keys "device",
            "action" and "event". The values should be strings matching the
            device, action and event type ids defined in the respective xml
            files for the user interface. If two extensions use the same
            type id unpredictable things will happen, so don't do that.
            When the plugin gets a call from indigo to do something
            with a device, action or event it will look up the extension to
            call using the type ids.
        callbacks -- This should be set to a dictionary. Keys should be method
            names (which need to be unique in the plugin namespace) and
            values are functions. These will be added to the plugin dictionary
            so they can be used as user interface callbacks. Please note that
            methods will continue to be bound to the extension so self in
            those callbacks will be the extension instance, not the plugin
            instance. Complaints will be made to the error log if two
            extensions try to add methods with the same name.

    Methods stubbed in the base class that subclasses may implement:
        getDeviceList
        createDevices
        update
        status_notification
        event_notification
        disconnect_notification
        reconnect_notification

    In addition to the above, when an action/device/trigger with a type id
    found in the type_ids attribute is found in a call to any of the following
    plugin methods, the plugin will examine the extension to see if a method
    of the same name is implemented. If so, it will be called, otherwise
    the plugin will call the method in indigo.PluginBase for the default
    behavior:

        getActionConfigUiValues
        getDeviceConfigUiValues
        getEventConfigUiValues
        validateActionConfigUi
        validateDeviceConfigUi
        validateEventConfigUi
        closedActionConfigUi
        closedDeviceConfigUi
        closedEventConfigUi

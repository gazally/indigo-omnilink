In terminal:
sudo easy_install-2.6 pip
sudo easy_install-2.6 pip py4j

Then install the Java developer kit. Go to oracle.com, and from their menu choose Products, Developer Tools, and then Java SE JDK.  Choose the version of the JDK they are currently recommending for Mac OS X in the dmg version. Run the installer in the dmg, then go back to the Terminal and type

java -version

and it should tell you the version number you just installed.
